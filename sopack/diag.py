"""Host-side diagnostics: the terminal output, the rotating log, and the per-run record.

Why this module is called `diag` and not `log`
----------------------------------------------
`apk.repackage()` has a parameter named `log` (the on-device stub-log boolean). A module named
`log` would be shadowed by it inside that function body, so `log.debug(...)` there would resolve
to a bool and raise AttributeError on every call. `repackage`'s signature is library API that
the tests call directly, so the module took the different name instead of the parameter.

What this replaces
------------------
Every diagnostic used to be a bare `print()`, which meant a failure on a customer's machine left
nothing to inspect: the scrollback was gone, and the details that actually explain a failure
(resolved config, which wb_keygen was picked, lief's version, apksigner's stderr, the traceback)
were never printed at all because the terminal output is deliberately terse.

The layout, and why there are two views
---------------------------------------
    <dir>/sopack.log[.1-.N]   rotating firehose, every run interleaved, run-id + pid tagged
    <dir>/index.jsonl         ONE COMPACT LINE PER RUN, append-only: the batch view
    <dir>/.lock               flock target for pruning and index trimming
    <dir>/runs/<run-id>/      report.json + run.log - one self-contained record per pack

They do different jobs. `sopack.log` is a chronological firehose with a hard byte cap;
`runs/<id>/` is the unit you attach to a bug report, and a run's log and its report are created
and pruned TOGETHER so they can never disagree. The driving use case is a *batch* - customers
pack many APKs repeatedly - which is why a single overwritten `last-run.json` would be useless:
40 packs would preserve one record and destroy 39, and a batch is exactly where "three of these
failed and I don't know which" happens.

Invariants worth keeping
------------------------
* **The terminal output is byte-for-byte what it was before this module existed.** The console
  handler emits `record.getMessage()` with no level prefix and no timestamp, INFO to stdout and
  WARNING+ to stderr, mirroring the previous `print()` / `print(file=sys.stderr)` split. A test
  diffs the two streams separately against master.
* **Logging must never break a pack.** Every filesystem operation here is best-effort: an
  unwritable log directory degrades to console-only with one warning. A packer that refuses to
  run because it cannot open its own log file is a worse tool than one that just does not log.
* **The destination comes from the config, but a config error is what most needs logging.** So
  `bootstrap()` installs the console handler plus an in-memory buffer, and `open_run()` flushes
  that buffer into the files once the destination is known. A ConfigError still gets a complete
  run directory, at the default location.
