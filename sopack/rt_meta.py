"""Pack/parse the two `cipher: wbaes` metadata regions. MUST match stub/sopk_rt.h exactly
(packed, little-endian).

Two artifacts, two regions:

  `TargetRegion` ('SRTT', 96-byte header + soname tail) is appended to each THIN per-target
  helper (`libsopk_rt_<target>.so`). Its ctor (stub/sopk_rt.c) locates it by magic.

  `WbRegion` ('SRTW', 24-byte header + wpass/blob tail) is appended to the ONE shared provider
  (`libsopk_wb.so`) per ABI. `sopk_wb_k` (stub/sopk_wb.c) locates it the same way.

v3 split them. Up to v2 a single region carried both, so every helper shipped its own ~455 KB
blob. v2 = key wrapping (wbcrypto 2.0.0); v1 carried a bare AES-CTR `iv` and relied on
`wbc_crypt_ctr`, which 2.0.0 deleted.

WARNING FOR ANYONE EDITING `TargetRegion`: v3 kept the header at 96 bytes and `_FMT` textually
identical - `pass_len`/`blob_len` were replaced by `flags`/`reserved` of the same widths. So
`HDR_SIZE == 96` and a literal-`_FMT` assertion do NOT detect v2/v3 drift. The **magic** is what
does; keep the `b"SRTT"` and version-3 assertions in tests/test_rt_meta.py.
