"""The sopack config file (YAML) - every setting except the input and output file.

    sopack pack in.apk -o out.apk [--config PATH]
    sopack pack in.aab -o out.aab [--config PATH]

There is no key for the container format either: APK-vs-AAB is detected from the file's
contents (`sopack.container.detect`), so it is a fact about the input rather than a setting,
and a key would let a caller declare the wrong one. Note that the whole ``signing:`` block is
inapplicable to an AAB - sopack never signs a bundle.

Lookup order: an explicit ``--config PATH`` (which must exist), then ``./config.yaml``,
then the built-in defaults in `Config.default()` - so a bare pack still works on a machine
that has no config file at all.

This module owns EVERY default. `cli._cmd_pack` passes each value explicitly to
`apk.repackage`, whose own signature defaults are library API (the tests call it directly),
so the long-standing skew between the two layers - the CLI defaulted `cipher` to `wbaes`
while `repackage` defaults it to `chacha20` - stops mattering rather than being papered
over. Nothing here reads `repackage`'s defaults and nothing there reads these.

Two deliberate omissions, so a later reader does not "fix" them:

* **No `wb-keygen` key.** `provision.find_wb_keygen` probes `vendor/wbc/bin/wb_keygen`,
  then a portable bundle, then `$SOPACK_WBKEYGEN`, then PATH - an order chosen so a stale
  export cannot beat the keygen `build_wbaes.sh` just gated. A config key would re-open
  "where does it rank?" for no gain.
* **`${VAR}` expansion is scoped to the three keystore fields**, not applied globally. Those
  are the only values anyone needs to keep out of a committed file, and a global expansion
  would make a library literally named `${...}` impossible to write.

The sample config is the module constant `SAMPLE_YAML` rather than a package data file, and
that is not incidental: `scripts/artifact_generation.sh` stages the portable wheel with
`cp "$SOPACK"/sopack/*.py`, so a `config.sample.yaml` sitting in this package would silently
not reach the wheel and `sopack init-config` would fail on exactly the toolchain-less
machine the bundle exists for. A string in a .py file rides along for free.
