"""sopack command-line interface.

    sopack pack in.apk -o out.apk [--config PATH]
    sopack pack in.aab -o out.aab [--config PATH]
    sopack init-config [-o PATH]

The command line carries only the input and output file, and whether that file is an APK or an
Android App Bundle is DETECTED from its contents (`sopack/container.py`) rather than declared.
Every other setting - cipher, ABIs, library selection, keystore, signing and logging - lives in
a YAML config file. sopack reads
`--config PATH` if given (an error if it does not exist), else `./config.yaml`, else its
built-in defaults.

`sopack init-config` writes a fully commented config.yaml, every key set to its default, so
an unedited one packs exactly like a bare `sopack pack`. `config.sample.yaml` in the repo is
the same file.

Two things here exist for CALLERS rather than humans, because sopack is increasingly driven by
other tools:

* **A stable exit code per failure class** (`sopack/exitcodes.py`). Every failure used to
  collapse to 1, so a wrapper could tell "it broke" but not what broke.
* **A per-run record** (`sopack/report.py`) under the log directory, carrying the number of
  encrypted libraries and the reason for every one that was skipped. That is where counts live:
  an exit status is 8 bits and cannot carry both a class and a count.

The terminal output is unchanged by both. It goes through `diag.emit` instead of `print`, with a
formatter that emits the message verbatim, so stdout and stderr are byte-for-byte what they were.
