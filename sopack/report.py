"""The machine-readable run record: `report.json` per run, plus one `index.jsonl` line.

This is the half of the result that an exit code cannot carry. A process exit status is 8 bits,
so it can say *what class* of thing happened but not "3 of 6 libraries were encrypted, and here
is why the other 3 were not" - see `sopack/exitcodes.py` for the full reasoning. Everything
quantitative lives here instead.

Two files, two jobs:

* **`runs/<id>/report.json`** - the complete record for one pack: every encrypted library with
  its .text range and hijack strategy, every skip with its reason, the per-ABI tally, the host
  environment. This is the file to attach to a bug report.
* **`index.jsonl`** - ONE COMPACT LINE PER RUN, appended. This is the batch primitive, and the
  reason the design is not a single overwritten `last-run.json`: customers pack many APKs
  repeatedly, so a single file would preserve one run and destroy the rest, and a batch is
  exactly where "three of these failed and I don't know which" happens. With this:

      jq -c 'select(.exit_code!=0)|{apk,exit_code,error}' index.jsonl
      jq -s 'group_by(.status)|map({(.[0].status):length})' index.jsonl

Everything here is derived from `apk.RepackResult` and the resolved `Config`, both of which
already carry what is needed - no extra bookkeeping is threaded through the pack.
