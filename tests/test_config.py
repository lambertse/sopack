"""The YAML config layer: the sample, the defaults, and every way a config can be wrong.

The command line carries only the input and output APK, so this module is where all the
validation that argparse used to do now lives. Two properties matter more than the rest and
have several tests each:

* `libraries.include` absent/null (auto-select everything) is NOT the same as `include: []`.
  apk.repackage() branches on `wanted_libs is None`, and collapsing the two would silently
  widen a pack to the whole APK.
* An unknown or misplaced key is an ERROR. `--ciper xor` used to be an argparse failure;
  `ciper: xor` must not quietly pack with the default cipher instead.
