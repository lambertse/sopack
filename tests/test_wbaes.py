"""`--cipher wbaes` injection tests.

Three tiers, deliberately:

* Everything driven by `tests/fixtures/mini_arm64.so` runs with **no setup at all** - it is a
  committed 50 KB aarch64 `.so` built for this purpose (see `mini_arm64.c` for the three
  properties it must keep). That covers the guards and the `.dynstr` re-sort behaviour that
  the whole mode depends on.
* The two full-injection tests additionally need a **host** `wb_keygen`, because `--cipher
  wbaes` seals a real white-box blob and there is no way to fake that meaningfully. They skip
  without one.
* The strip tests need a compiler that emits **ELF** - not merely a compiler. macOS `cc`
  produces Mach-O, so there `_elf_cc` falls back to the NDK's clang if `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` is
  set, and they skip if it is not.

The on-device decrypt is validated separately: the host round-trip probe in
`docs/technical/WBAES.md` Phase 3, then Phase 6 on a device.
