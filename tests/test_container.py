"""APK-vs-AAB detection, and packing a bundle through the same code path.

The two things most worth pinning here are NOT the happy path:

  * an APK's nested `assets/lib/<abi>/x.so` must stay invisible to selection. The tempting way to
    support bundles was one regex with an optional module prefix, which would have started
    encrypting entries that sopack has ignored in every APK ever packed - a silent widening with no
    error to notice.
  * a bundle's added artifacts must land in the SAME module directory as their target, and the
    shared white-box provider must be one per (module, abi) carrying one blob per ABI. Get either
    half wrong and the failure is on-device only: a thin helper whose DT_NEEDED cannot resolve, or
    one that unwraps against another module's blob.
