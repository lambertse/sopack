# Troubleshooting

Concrete failure modes seen with sopack, what causes each, and how to confirm/fix.
Background for all of these is in [`technical/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./technical/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Start here: every pack leaves a record

You do not need to reproduce a failure to diagnose it. Every `sopack pack` writes a self-contained
record under **`~/.sopack/logs/`** (override with `logging.file.dir`, or `$SOPACK_LOG_DIR`):

```
~/.sopack/logs/
├── sopack.log[.1-.4]   rotating firehose, every run interleaved   (50 MB x 5)
├── index.jsonl         ONE LINE PER RUN - the batch view
└── runs/<run-id>/
    ├── report.json     the full record: every library, every skip and its reason
    └── run.log         that run's own DEBUG log
```

**If you are filing a bug, attach `runs/<run-id>/`.** It already contains what would otherwise be
three rounds of questions: the fully resolved config (passwords redacted), `lief.__version__`, the
resolved paths of `wb_keygen`/`apksigner`/`zipalign`, every external command with its stdout and
stderr, the per-library selection decisions, and the Python traceback.

### Triaging a batch

This is what the per-run records are for - a run of 40 APKs leaves 40 records, not one:

```bash
L=~/.sopack/logs

# which runs failed, and why
jq -c 'select(.exit_code!=0)|{apk,exit_code,status,error}' $L/index.jsonl

# a count by outcome
jq -s 'group_by(.status)|map({(.[0].status):length})' $L/index.jsonl

# packs that SUCCEEDED but shipped libraries in cleartext - exit 0 hides this
jq -c 'select(.exit_code==0 and .failed_count>0)|{apk,encrypted_count,failed_count}' $L/index.jsonl

# how many libraries got encrypted overall
jq -s 'map(.encrypted_count)|add' $L/index.jsonl
```

Export **`$SOPACK_RUN_TAG`** once before a batch and every record carries it, so one filter scopes
every query to that batch:

```bash
export SOPACK_RUN_TAG=nightly-42
for f in *.apk; do sopack pack "$f" -o "packed-$f"; done
jq -c 'select(.tag=="nightly-42" and .exit_code!=0)' ~/.sopack/logs/index.jsonl
```

Retention: the newest `logging.file.max-runs` (200) run directories are kept, while `index.jsonl`
keeps far more (`max-index-lines`, 5000) because it is the batch history. A run whose directory has
been pruned keeps its index line with `"dir": null` and `"detail_pruned": true` - the query still
answers, it just tells you the detail is gone.

## Exit codes

`sopack pack` returns a stable code per failure class, so a wrapper can branch without parsing
output. The *count* of encrypted libraries is deliberately **not** in the exit status - an exit
status is 8 bits, so it cannot carry both a class and a count (and a negative code would arrive as
255). Read `encrypted_count` from the record instead.

| Code | Status | Meaning | Where to look |
|-----:|--------|---------|---------------|
| `0` | `ok` | at least one library encrypted, **or** the input had no native libraries at all and was copied through unchanged | check `failed_count` (0 can still mean libraries shipped in cleartext) and `passthrough` |
| `1` | `internal-error` | unmodelled failure; treat as a sopack bug | the traceback in `runs/<id>/run.log` |
| `2` | `usage-error` | bad command line, a removed flag, or `init-config` over an existing file | **stderr only - there is no run record**, because nothing was packed |
| `3` | `config-error` | config missing, unparseable, or an unknown/misplaced key | the message names the key |
| `4` | `input-error` | input missing, unreadable, not a zip, or a zip that is neither an APK nor an AAB | [§neither an APK nor an AAB](#error-file-is-a-zip-but-neither-an-apk-nor-an-android-app-bundle) |
| `5` | `selection-error` | nothing matched `libraries.include` | [§no .so entries matched](#error-no-so-entries-matched-the-requested-list-nothing-to-encrypt) |
| `6` | `nothing-encrypted` | native libraries were present and **none** got protected (excluded, outside `abis:`, or they failed to inject) | [§none of the N entries were packed](#error-none-of-the-n-libso-entries-in-this-apk-were-packed) |
| `7` | `toolchain-error` | missing stub blob or helper skeleton, no `wb_keygen`, sealing failed | [§could not find a host wb_keygen](#error-could-not-find-a-host-wb_keygen-on-a-fresh-checkout) |
| `8` | `inject-error` | injection, self-verify, or a 16 KB alignment refusal | [§16 KB](#so-is-not-16-kb-page-compatible-to-begin-with-arm64) |
| `9` | `signing-error` | `apksigner` was found but failed. Only reachable with `signing.sign: true`, which is **not** the default | [§could not find apksigner](#could-not-find-apksigner-zipalign-keytool) |
| `10` | `output-error` | could not write the output APK | |
| `11` | `already-packed` | the input is a sopack **output**; re-packing was refused | [§this APK is already packed](#error-this-apk-is-already-packed-by-sopack) |

Note `2` is reserved: `argparse` uses it for a malformed command line, so nothing else may take it.
Codes are positive and 1-byte; **there are no negative codes**, because an exit status is 8 bits
unsigned and `sys.exit(-1)` reaches the shell as `255`.

An **unsigned but successfully packed** APK is `0`, and since `signing.sign` defaults to `false`
that is now the normal outcome - detect it with `"signed": false` in the record rather than an exit
code. That field has **three** causes and only the first two are things to act on:

| `"signed": false` because | how to tell | what it means |
|---|---|---|
| signing was disabled or unavailable | `passthrough: false`, `container: "apk"` | the APK is packed but not installable until you sign it |
| the output is an **AAB** | `container: "aab"` | by design - sopack never signs a bundle (see [§My packed AAB is unsigned](#my-packed-aab-is-unsigned)) |
| nothing was rewritten | `passthrough: true` | the input had no native libraries, so it was copied through and **still carries its original signature** |

A batch filter looking for broken packs therefore wants `signed == false and passthrough == false
and container == "apk"`, not `signed == false` alone.

## The on-device diagnostic

For a pack that succeeds but misbehaves *on the device*, the most useful diagnostic is packing with
**`logging.stub-log: true`** in your config and reading logcat:

```bash
adb logcat -s sopack:I
```

The stub emits staged lines (`A:entry`, `B:…`, `C:mmap…`, `D:decrypt…`, `E:mremap…`,
`H:native .text decrypted OK`). The **last** line you see tells you how far it got.

Note `logging.stub-log`/`logging.allow-helper-log` are about the **device**; the
`logging.file` block above is about the **host**. They are unrelated despite sharing a section.

---

## `error: could not find a host wb_keygen` on a fresh checkout

`cipher: wbaes` is the **default**, and it needs artifacts that are built rather than
committed. Nothing is wrong; the build step has not been run:

```bash
git submodule update --init      # the pinned whitebox-cryptography dependency
pip install -e .
./scripts/build_wbaes.sh         # host keygen + Android lib + both skeletons
```

`build_wbaes.sh` leaves the keygen at `vendor/wbc/bin/wb_keygen`, which is the first thing
`provision.find_wb_keygen` probes - so there is nothing to export afterwards, and no
`--wb-keygen` flag to pass (it was removed). The same applies to
`error: wbaes … skeleton for <abi> not found`, which is the same cause one step later.

Three ways out, in order of preference:

- run the build above (needs the NDK, macOS or Linux/x86_64 for O-MVLL, and network once);
- install from a portable bundle (`artifacts/install.sh`), which carries all of it prebuilt;
- pack with **`cipher: chacha20`**, which needs no build at all but ships the key inside the
  library (whitened). This is the right answer for a quick test, not for a release.

**A plain `pip install .` from a checkout cannot work with the default cipher**, even after
`build_wbaes.sh`: the skeletons are gitignored and deliberately not package data (see the note
in `scripts/artifact_generation.sh` about why `pyproject.toml` must not gain `stubs/*.so`). Use
`pip install -e .`, or install a bundle.

## App crashes with SIGILL inside the dynamic linker at launch

```
Fatal signal 4 (SIGILL), code 1 (ILL_ILLOPC) ... in ...libX.so
  #00 ...libX.so (offset ...)
  #01 linker64 __dl__ZL10call_array...      <-- DT_INIT_ARRAY iteration
  #02 linker64 __dl__ZN6soinfo17call_constructorsEv
  #03 linker64 __dl__Z9do_dlopen...
```

**Cause:** a constructor in `DT_INIT_ARRAY` ran on **still-encrypted** `.text`. The
stub never decrypted, because the injector hijacked an `INIT_ARRAY` slot - and on
position-independent libraries those slots are overwritten by `R_*_RELATIVE`
relocations at load, which revert the stub pointer to the original constructor.

**Status:** fixed. sopack now **never hijacks `DT_INIT_ARRAY`**; for a library with an
`INIT_ARRAY` but no `DT_INIT` (libflutter.so and most NDK C++ libs) it **adds a
`DT_INIT`**, which the loader runs *before* `INIT_ARRAY`. Confirm your build uses the
fix:

```bash
llvm-readelf -dW lib/arm64-v8a/libX.so | grep -E 'INIT'
# expect DT_INIT present; strategy in the pack output should read "DT_INIT-inplace"
```

If you're on an old build, re-pack with current sopack. (`_self_verify` now asserts
`DT_INIT` points at the stub, so this can no longer ship silently.)

---

## The exact same code crashes on my build but not on a build you gave me (arm64)

**Cause:** the arm64 stub reached its metadata via `adrp`+`add` (page-relative), which
is only correct when the injected segment loads at a **page-aligned** vaddr. Different
LIEF versions place the segment at different alignments; a non-page-aligned placement
made `adrp` mis-address the key/flags → garbage decrypt (and, because the flags were
misread, no stub-log line, so it looked like the stub never ran).

**Status:** fixed. The arm64 stub is built with **`-mcmodel=tiny`** (emits `adr`,
byte-relative, alignment-independent), and `build_stubs.sh` fails if any `adrp` remains.
Confirm your rebuilt blob:

```bash
llvm-objdump -d sopack/stubs/stub_arm64-v8a.bin | grep -c adrp   # must be 0
```

Rebuild the stubs (`bash stub/build_stubs.sh`) and re-pack.

---

## `error: bytes after .dynamic terminator ...` / `cannot add DT_INIT in place`

**Cause:** adding a `DT_INIT` works by overwriting `.dynamic`'s `DT_NULL` terminator
and using the following word as the new terminator - which requires that following slot
to read as `DT_NULL` at runtime. For some library layouts (and some LIEF versions) it
doesn't.

**What sopack already handles:** the runtime zero-ness is decided by the containing
`PT_LOAD`'s `filesz`/`memsz` (bytes beyond `filesz` are kernel zero-filled), and only
the `d_tag` **word** of the follow-slot needs to be zero (bionic ignores `d_val` on a
`DT_NULL`). Both are accounted for.

**If it still fires,** the slot after `.dynamic` is genuinely file-backed, mapped, and
has a non-zero tag - the tool refuses rather than corrupt the library. This is a
per-library limitation of the in-place method; report the library.

---

## `<lib>.so is not 16 KB-page compatible to begin with` (arm64)

**Cause: the input library, not the packer.** It was linked without
`-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384`, so its own `PT_LOAD` segments are 4 KB-aligned and it cannot load
on a 16 KB-page device *unpacked either*. The error lists each offending segment with its
offset, vaddr and alignment - `align 0x1000` on all of them is the signature.

**Fix:** rebuild that library with 16 KB alignment (one link flag, or NDK r27+, which does it by
default):

```bash
-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384                              # plain link
-DANDROID_SUPPORT_FLEXIBLE_PAGE_SIZES=ON                # Gradle + CMake
APP_SUPPORT_FLEXIBLE_PAGE_SIZES=true                    # ndk-build
readelf -lW libfoo.so | awk '/LOAD/{print $3,$NF}'      # verify: every align 0x4000
```

Often only *one* module in an app is missing the flag - check the app's other `.so` files before
assuming it is a whole-project setting. The same rebuild is what Play's 16 KB requirement needs,
so it is not work spent only on sopack.

**Meanwhile,** the library ships in cleartext (auto-select demotes this to a per-library skip and
the run summary lists it). There is currently no flag to pack it anyway for 4 KB-only devices,
though such a build would be correct - see the gaps in
[`technical/PAGE-ALIGNMENT.md`](./technical/PAGE-ALIGNMENT.md) §7. That document also explains,
step by step, what the decryptor's page window does to a 4 KB-aligned library and why the
resulting crash lands far from the cause.

**Note the default cipher reports this differently.** Only `cipher: wbaes` names the input;
`chacha20`/`xor` raise a bare `LOAD seg align 4096 not multiple of 16384` for the identical
cause. If you see that, check the input's `readelf -lW` before suspecting the packer.

---

## `has a LOAD segment that breaks 16 KB loading` (arm64)

**First: upgrade LIEF.** `pip install -U 'lief>=1.0'`, then re-pack. This is almost always the
whole fix, and the packer now prints the LIEF version in the error for exactly that reason.

**Cause:** sopack's own output, not your library. The check re-reads the input first and would
have said *"is not 16 KB-page compatible to begin with"* if the input were at fault.

**Which artifact?** The message names it, and it can be any of three - they are emitted at
different points and only the first has an input to compare against:

| Artifact | Emitted by | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `the packed target <soname>` | `_inject_wbaes` steps 2-3 | the only one with an `orig_path`, hence *"its input … is clean"* |
| `the emitted thin helper libsopk_rt_<t>.so` | `_emit_helper`, per target | *"emitted from a skeleton, so there is no input to blame"* |
| `the emitted shared provider libsopk_wb.so` | `emit_provider`, once per ABI **after** the per-target loop | a target failure aborts before this one is even reached |

Older builds printed *"the input was clean, so this one is ours"* for all three, including the
two that have no input - so a log from those cannot be attributed. Upgrade sopack, re-run, and
read which artifact it names.

**Known trigger: the LIEF version.** sopack asks for 16 KB (`seg.alignment = SEGMENT_ALIGN`), but
some LIEF builds relocate the program headers or invent an extra 4 KB-aligned LOAD when the
append does not fit the existing layout. It is layout- and size-dependent, so it shows up on
larger libraries while smaller ones pack cleanly. This is the same hazard that makes
`_inject_wbaes` avoid LIEF's `add_library` entirely (see `docs/technical/ARCHITECTURE.md` §11f);
`add(seg)` is normally safe, but not on every LIEF version.

Observed on a macOS host with LIEF **`0.17.0`** packing a 1.66 MB arm64 library
(`libvosWrapperEx.so`, `cipher: wbaes`). On LIEF **`1.0.0`**, same file and same sopack commit,
all three artifacts come out clean - target (2 LOADs in, 3 out, all `0x4000`), thin helper
(6 LOADs), and provider (4 LOADs), every one `0x4000`-aligned and congruent. The provider was
checked with a *synthetic* region of representative size (~455 KB blob) rather than a real seal,
since the layout question does not need a host `wb_keygen`; the alignment result is what stands,
not the exact byte count. Hence the `lief>=1.0` floor in `pyproject.toml` (1.0.0 is on PyPI with
macOS arm64 wheels, so the upgrade resolves on an Apple Silicon host). When reporting a
recurrence, include:

```bash
python3 -c "import lief; print(lief.__version__)"
readelf -lW <input.so>  | awk '/LOAD/{print $2, $3, $NF}'   # the input's offsets/vaddrs/alignments
readelf -lW <packed.so> | awk '/LOAD/{print $2, $3, $NF}'   # and the output's
```

Note `awk '/LOAD/{print $NF}'` on two files is easy to misread: this library has **2** LOAD
segments, so four printed lines means you ran it on the same file twice, not that you saw the
output.

**Workarounds if `>=1.0` still fails:** report it with the table row it named, exclude that library
(add it to `libraries.exclude`, or leave it out of `libraries.include`), or pack it only for a
device class that does
not require 16 KB pages. Under auto-select this failure is already demoted to a per-library skip -
the library then ships in cleartext, which the run summary calls out.

**Do not disable the check.** It is refusing to emit an APK that would fail to load on 16 KB-page
hardware, which Play requires 64-bit apps to support - the failure is the guard working.

---

## No `sopack` line in logcat at all

Not necessarily a failure. Check, in order:

1. **Is `logging.stub-log: true` in your config?** Without it the stub is silent by design.
2. **Which ABI loaded?** The device loads one ABI. If you only encrypted `arm64-v8a`
   but the device pulled `armeabi-v7a`, it loaded the *unencrypted* copy - nothing to
   report. Encrypt the ABI your device uses (or all of them).
3. **Filter correctly:** `adb logcat -s sopack:I` (tag `sopack`, level info).
4. If you see `A:entry` but not `H:…`, the stub ran but a syscall failed - the last
   staged line names the stage (e.g. `E:mremap FAILED`). See the mremap note below.

---

## `avc: denied { execmod }` (should not happen)

sopack decrypts into **anonymous** memory (`execmem`, allowed), never re-executes a
modified file mapping (`execmod`, denied). If you see `execmod`, something is loading a
library that decrypts in place - not sopack's path. `execmem` denials, by contrast,
only appear on unusually hardened ROMs (GrapheneOS-style) that restrict even JIT-style
mappings.

To confirm it is the device and not the packer, run
[`stub/execmem-probe/`](../stub/execmem-probe/) on it - a standalone `.so` that exercises
the same decrypt-and-execute path with no decryption and no packing involved. If the probe
is denied there, packed libraries cannot run on that device.

## `E:mremap FAILED` in the log, app still runs or crashes later

Some devices reject `MREMAP_FIXED` over a file-backed mapping. The stub has a fallback
(`munmap` the `.text` window, `mmap(MAP_FIXED)` fresh anon pages, copy decrypted bytes
in) and logs `E2:mmap-fixed fallback ok`. If both `E` and `E2` fail, the library is
left encrypted and will crash on first call - report the device/ABI, and include the
result of [`stub/execmem-probe/`](../stub/execmem-probe/) on that device, which isolates
the `mremap` step from everything else.

---

## App installs and launches but then reports tampering / exits / behaves oddly

**Cause:** re-signing gives the APK a **new signing certificate**. Apps with
integrity/anti-tamper or signature-pinning checks (very common in banking/security
apps - look for libraries like `libpki.so`, `libZeroCore.so`, V-Key/`libvos*`) detect
the new identity and refuse to run. This is the **app's own protection**, not a sopack
bug, and sopack can't defeat it.

Confirm the encryption itself is fine (static checks in `BUILDING.md` §5, and the
`sopack` decrypt line appears) to separate "encryption broke it" from "the app rejected
the re-sign."

---

## `error: no .so entries matched the requested list; nothing to encrypt`

The names in `libraries.include` didn't match any native library in the input.

- **If the input is an AAB**, its entries are `<module>/lib/<abi>/<name>.so`. You do **not** need
  the module prefix - `libapp`, `libapp.so`, `lib/arm64-v8a/libapp.so` and
  `base/lib/arm64-v8a/libapp.so` all match - so this error means the name itself is wrong, not the
  shape.

- The trailing `.so` is optional and fnmatch globs work, so `libapp`, `libapp.so` and
  `lib/arm64-v8a/libapp.so` are equivalent. (Before this was fixed, `include` required an
  exact string while `exclude` two lines below it did not, so a bare `libapp` matched
  nothing and produced exactly this error.)
- If one entry contains commas, you wrote a comma list where YAML wants a list. Each name
  is its own `- ` item; commas are part of the name.
- Confirm the exact names/ABIs present:

  ```bash
  # works for both containers: an APK's libraries are lib/<abi>/*.so, a bundle's are
  # <module>/lib/<abi>/*.so
  python3 -c "import zipfile,re,sys;[print(n) for n in zipfile.ZipFile(sys.argv[1]).namelist() if re.search(r'(^|/)lib/[^/]+/[^/]+\.so$', n)]" in.apk
  ```
- A bare basename matches every selected ABI; make sure the library actually ships for
  an ABI in `abis:`. **`abis:` defaults to `arm64-v8a` alone** - if the library is only
  present for another ABI, use `abis: all` or name that ABI.
- Removing `libraries.include` entirely encrypts every `lib/<abi>/*.so` and sidesteps the
  question.

---

## `error: none of the N lib/<abi>/*.so entries in this APK were packed`

(For a bundle the same error reads `none of the N <module>/lib/<abi>/*.so entries in this AAB were
packed` - the wording names the container it actually saw.)

Auto-select found libraries but every one was excluded or failed to inject. The per-library
reasons are printed above the error.

- `excluded by 'libsopk_*'` on **every** entry used to be how a re-pack surfaced. It should no
  longer reach here at all: an already-packed container is refused up front with exit **11**
  (see [§this APK is already packed](#error-this-apk-is-already-packed-by-sopack)). If you see
  this, the artifacts were renamed - pack the original.
- `abi not selected` on every entry means the APK ships no `arm64-v8a` libraries; use
  `abis: all` or name the ABI it does ship.
- `excluded by '...'` from your own `libraries.exclude` - loosen the glob. Note it also
  overrides a name in `libraries.include`.
- Everything failing to inject points at a shared cause; read the individual messages and
  see the per-library sections above.

---

## `error: <file> is a zip, but neither an APK nor an Android App Bundle`

sopack classifies the input by its **contents**, not its extension: a root `AndroidManifest.xml`
means APK, a root `BundleConfig.pb` means AAB. Exit code **4** (`input-error`).

- If you passed a plain zip, an `.apks` (a bundletool *output*, a zip of split APKs), or an
  extracted-and-rezipped directory that lost its manifest, that is the cause. Pack the original
  APK or `.aab`.
- An `.apks` archive is not supported and there is nothing to fix in it: it is already the
  generated, signed output of `bundletool build-apks`. Pack the `.aab` it came from instead.
- The name is never consulted, so a correctly-formed bundle named `.apk` (or the reverse) packs
  fine - you get a warning that `-o`'s extension disagrees, and nothing more.

---

## My packed AAB is unsigned

That is by design, not a failure - the pack's last lines say so, and `report.json` records
`"container": "aab"` with `"signed": false`. Three reasons:

- `apksigner` cannot read a bundle at all (it wants a root `AndroidManifest.xml`; a bundle's is at
  `<module>/manifest/` in protobuf form).
- A bundle is JAR-signed, and what Play verifies on upload is your **upload key**, which sopack
  does not have.
- The original signature *is* stripped, and has to be: `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` carries a SHA-256
  digest of every entry, so once a library is rewritten it can never verify again.

Sign it yourself:

```bash
jarsigner -keystore <your-upload-keystore> -signedjar signed.aab out.aab <alias>
jarsigner -verify signed.aab          # expect "jar verified"
```

If you are batch-triaging, note that `"signed": false` must be read **together with**
`"container"`: on an APK it means signing was skipped or unavailable, on an AAB it is the normal
successful outcome.

---

## A library I expected to be encrypted shipped in cleartext

Under auto-select (no `libraries.include`) an injection failure is a **warning, not an error** -
the original library is written back unchanged so the pack still produces a working APK.
Check the run's summary:

```
Skipped (selected but could not be injected - these ship in CLEARTEXT):
  lib/arm64-v8a/libfoo.so: <reason>
```

Look the reason up in this document. To make that failure fatal instead, name the library
explicitly in `libraries.include` - explicit selection never degrades to a skip.

Also check the `Not selected:` block. Every generated config ships `libraries.exclude` listing
`libsopk_*`, `libvosWrapperEx` and `libflutter`, so those appear here by default - delete
`libflutter` from your config to pack it, but note the other two are enforced in code and stay
excluded whatever the config says. Anything outside `abis:` is listed as `abi not selected`.

---

## Skip: `injecting the target changed the dynamic symbol names` / `changed what '<sym>' resolves to`

Both come from `_assert_dynsyms_equivalent`, the `cipher: wbaes` guard that refuses to ship a
library whose `dlsym` behaviour the injection changed. Which message you get says what happened,
and they are not the same problem.

**`changed the dynamic symbol names (e.g. 'x' -> 'y')`** - the set of dynamic symbol names is not
the same before and after. This is the shipped bug of
[`technical/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./technical/ARCHITECTURE.md) §11f: `DT_STRTAB` points at a copy of
`.dynstr` whose layout does not match the `st_name` offsets in `.dynsym`, so names resolve
mid-string. The library would load and then return `NULL` from `dlsym`, which is why the packer
refuses. There is nothing to configure - it means the write went wrong, so file it with the
`report.json` from the run rather than working around it.

**`changed what '<sym>' resolves to`, `left DT_HASH unable to resolve ...`, or `changed the symbol
a relocation targets`** - the names survived, but a symbol moved to a different address/size, the
hash chains no longer find it, or a relocation now points at a different symbol. Same conclusion:
a broken write, not a configuration problem.

**A `WARNING: ... came out with .dynsym in a different ORDER` is not a failure.** LIEF normalises
`.dynsym` (undefined entries first) when it rebuilds a library, and on a table that interleaves
imports with exports the list genuinely moves. Every name still resolves identically, so the pack
continues. If you are on an older sopack that *skipped* such a library - reporting
`'call_vm_loadTA' -> '_16923bf24c…L'` with the `DT_STRTAB ... out of sync` wording - that
diagnosis was wrong: the guard compared index order, and the fix is in the packer, not the app.
`lib/arm64-v8a/libtaInterface.so` of the V-OS corpus is the known case.

## `invalid linker name in argument '-fuse-ld=lld'` when building stubs

Your `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` points at something that isn't a real NDK (e.g. a version like
`4.8.0`). A valid NDK is r19+ and bundles `lld` (version like `27.0.12077973`). Install
a real NDK, or unset `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` to fall back to plain LLVM on `PATH`.

## `could not find apksigner` / `zipalign` / `keytool`

- `apksigner`: set `SOPACK_APKSIGNER_JAR=/path/to/apksigner.jar`, or put `apksigner` on
  `PATH`, or set `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`.
- `zipalign`: not required - sopack falls back to its built-in Python 16 KB aligner.
- `keytool`: install a JDK or set `JAVA_HOME`.

## `incompatible pointer to integer conversion` building the stub (NDK r27)

NDK r27's clang treats `-Wint-conversion` as an error. The stub already casts pointers
to `long` in the fixed-`mmap` path; if you hit this after editing `syscalls.h`, add the
explicit `(long)` cast. Rebuild with `bash stub/build_stubs.sh`.

# `cipher: wbaes` failures

This mode **fails closed**: instead of degrading, every failure path calls `abort()`. That is
deliberate - the helper has no fallback, so returning would leave the target running encrypted
`.text` and crashing later somewhere unrelated. The trade-off is that a release build logs
nothing, so the *only* thing that names the cause is the numeric reason code.

## The app dies with `SIGABRT` at launch - reading `sopk_fail_code`

The reason is stored in a `volatile unsigned int sopk_fail_code` before the abort, so it
survives into the tombstone's memory dump even in a stripped, non-logging build:

```bash
adb logcat -s sopk_rt sopk_wb DEBUG
adb shell ls /data/tombstones/          # then pull and search for sopk_fail_code
```

**Codes are stable and are never renumbered.** Low codes are the thin helper's own; anything in
**10..19** is the shared provider's, folded in as `10 + reason` (`stub/sopk_rt.c`,
`stub/sopk_wb.h`):

| code | meaning | usual cause |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | no metadata region found in self | **stale skeleton** - the ctor's version gate matched nothing. Rebuild both skeletons (WBAES.md Phase 4). This is the most common one. |
| 2 | bad region fields | region header failed sanity checks; packer/skeleton mismatch |
| 3 | target not loaded | the target soname was not mapped when the helper's ctor ran |
| 4, 5 | **retired** | were `WBC_OPEN`/`WBC_UNWRAP` before the v3 provider split. A tombstone showing these is from an **old build** - do not read it as a current failure mode. |
| 6 | scratch `mmap` failed | out of memory / mapping pressure |
| 7 | fixed anon remap failed | see `E:mremap FAILED` above - same root cause |
| 8 | `mprotect R-X` failed | SELinux, or a W^X policy issue |
| 9 | region tail exceeds segment | truncated or corrupted region |
| 11 | provider: bad argument | NULL pointer or wrong buffer length |
| 12 | provider: **ABI mismatch** | a mismatched helper/provider **pair** - one was rebuilt without the other |
| 13 | provider: no region found | stale or region-less provider |
| 14 | provider: bad region fields | packer/provider mismatch |
| 15 | provider: region tail past segment | truncated provider region |
| 16 | provider: `wbc_blob_kdf_tier` failed | the runtime and the blob format disagree - usually a pre-3.0.0 `libwbcrypto.a` linked against a v4 blob |
| 17 | provider: `wbc_open` failed | wrong passphrase (the whitening mirror drifted) or a tampered blob |
| 18 | provider: `wbc_unwrap_key` failed | the wrap convention drifted, or a foreign blob |

A bare **10** cannot occur - it would mean provider reason 0, which is success.

## `cannot locate symbol "sopk_wb_k"` / the app dies inside `dlopen`

The shared provider `lib/<abi>/libsopk_wb.so` is missing, or its `DT_SONAME` is not exactly
`libsopk_wb.so`. Each thin helper records that `DT_NEEDED` string **at link time** (Phase 4b),
so the packer asserts the soname rather than fixing it - it cannot fix it retroactively.

Check the output APK:

```bash
unzip -l out.apk | grep libsopk          # expect ONE libsopk_wb.so per ABI, plus one helper per target
readelf -dW sopk_wb_arm64-v8a.so | grep SONAME    # must be exactly libsopk_wb.so
```

If the soname is a *path* (`.../sopack/stubs/sopk_wb_arm64-v8a.so`), you built the provider
without `-Wl,-soname,libsopk_wb.so`. Rebuild it and then rebuild the thin helper against it.

## Pack fails: `skeleton is missing the build marker` / `rebuild both`

The skeleton in `sopack/stubs/` predates a region or ctor-flow change. This is the guard doing
its job: on device a stale skeleton is undiagnosable (code 1, above), so the packer turns it
into a build-time error instead. Re-run `./scripts/build_wbaes.sh`, which rebuilds both
artifacts together - and note the two markers differ on purpose, so a *fresh helper + stale
provider* pair is caught too.

## Pack fails: the blob was refused (`assert_light_blob`)

`provision.py` refuses anything but a **v≥4, tier-0 (`light`)** sealed blob:

- *"blames a stale keygen"* - your host `wb_keygen` is pre-3.0.0 and emits a v3 blob.
  Rebuild it with `./scripts/build_wbaes.sh --force` (the `--force` matters: both the host
  keygen and the Android archive are cached, and a stale one survives an SDK bump). That
  re-runs the submodule's `scripts/gen_blob.sh` and refreshes `vendor/wbc/bin/wb_keygen`.
  If the submodule itself is behind, update it first:
  `git submodule update --init` (or `--remote` to move the pin, which changes what ships).
- *"blames sopack"* - the blob is v4 but sealed at `medium`/`heavy`. `wb_keygen` **defaults to
  `heavy`**, so this means the `--kdf light` flag was dropped; a heavy blob costs ~266 ms of
  Argon2id and a transient 64 MiB *per library* on device.

## Pack fails: `libsopk_wb.so already exists in this APK`

You are packing an already-packed APK, and you got past the exit-11 gate below - which means
`allow-repack: true` is set. Reusing the existing provider would leave every thin helper
resolving against a **foreign** sealed blob, so no session key would unwrap and every target
would abort. Pack the original APK instead.

## `error: this APK is already packed by sopack`

Exit code **11** (`already-packed`). The input is one of sopack's own outputs. Pack the
**original** container.

Re-packing is not merely redundant, it is destructive. Under `cipher: wbaes` the second pack
seals a *new* long-term key, and the `libsopk_wb.so` already inside can neither be reused (its
blob will not unwrap the new helpers' session keys) nor replaced (the *old* helpers unwrap
against it) - so the app would abort on essentially every launch. Under the stub ciphers,
already-encrypted `.text` is simply encrypted a second time.

Detection is two-tiered, and the message names which tier fired:

| evidence | tier | effect |
|---|---|---|
| a `lib/<abi>/libsopk_wb.so` or `lib/<abi>/libsopk_rt_*.so` entry | definitive | refuse |
| a sopack build marker inside a library (including superseded ones) | definitive | refuse |
| a target that `DT_NEEDED`s `libsopk_rt_*` | definitive | refuse |
| a stub segment whose metadata de-whitens to the decinfo magic | definitive | refuse |
| `DT_INIT` into an R+X segment no section covers | heuristic | **warn only** |

The last row is deliberately not fatal: other packers emit the same segment shape, so refusing
on it would break a legitimate pack. It is also all that is left for an `obfuscate: true` pack,
whose stub differs in every app.

If you are certain the input is not a sopack output - or you genuinely intend a re-pack - set:

```yaml
allow-repack: true
```

That downgrades the refusal to a warning. It does not make re-packing work; it only stops
sopack from stopping you.

## A packed library never logs `- OK`, but the app runs

Not necessarily a failure: a library the app never loads never runs its helper. Establish which
it is before assuming. See [technical/WBAES.md](./technical/WBAES.md) Phase 6 - if the library
**is** mapped and there is no `- OK` line, its `.text` is running encrypted and it will `SIGILL`
when reached.
