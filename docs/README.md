# sopack documentation

Two audiences, two directories.

## Using sopack

Start here if you want to pack an APK.

- **[BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md)** - install the toolchain, build the stub blobs, pack an
  APK, verify the result. **Start here.** §6 covers the two harness scripts:
  `scripts/device_test.sh` (pack the whole `test_apks/` corpus and run it on a device) and
  `scripts/artifact_generation.sh` (build the portable `artifacts/` bundle - tool included, so
  the second machine needs no checkout).
- **[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)** - what this actually protects, the honest ceiling, and
  what is deliberately left visible. Read it before describing sopack to anyone else.
- **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - concrete failure modes (SIGILL at load,
  missing logcat line, signing/tamper issues, the `cipher: wbaes` fail codes, toolchain
  errors) with causes and fixes.

## Changing sopack

[`technical/`](./technical/) - the internals. You need these to modify the packer, the
stub, or the white-box integration; you do not need them to use the tool.

- **[technical/ARCHITECTURE.md](./technical/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - the deep dive: the Android
  constraints that shape the design, the three components (runtime stub, ELF injector, APK
  repackager), the reasoning and hard-won insights behind each decision, and the key
  lifecycle in both cipher modes.
- **[technical/WBAES.md](./technical/WBAES.md)** - everything about `cipher: wbaes`.
  Part I is the boundary with the **whitebox-cryptography** SDK: the version contract, what
  sopack consumes and refuses, the artifact flow, and what an upstream change breaks. Part II
  is the six-phase build-and-verify procedure. Read it before using or upgrading that mode -
  it has prerequisites the other modes do not.
- **[technical/PAGE-ALIGNMENT.md](./technical/PAGE-ALIGNMENT.md)** - 16 KB pages, end to end:
  why a 4 KB-aligned input library is unpackable, every mapping step from the APK entry offset
  to the decryptor's `mremap` window, which step crashes and how far from the cause, why the
  packer cannot repair the library, and which parts of the refusal are sopack's own limitation.
  Read it when a pack fails with a `16 KB` error.
- **[technical/HARDENING.md](./technical/HARDENING.md)** - the implementation of every
  anti-static-analysis technique (metadata whitening, string hygiene, the pack-time strip, and
  why section-header stripping was rejected), with the code and the tests that lock each one.
- **[technical/STATIC-ANALYSIS-REVIEW.md](./technical/STATIC-ANALYSIS-REVIEW.md)** - the review
  those techniques answer to. Eight findings (S1-S8), every one reproduced against a real
  shipped artifact in this repo rather than derived from reading source, each with its
  reproduction and its current status. Read it to know what sopack actually costs an analyst
  who never runs the app - including the two findings that are measured and reported rather
  than closed, and why. It also records how the obfuscation gate was calibrated, which is the
  short version of "do not replace a structural check with a threshold".
- **[technical/IMPROVEMENTS.md](./technical/IMPROVEMENTS.md)** - changes that are understood
  and deliberately **not** done, each with the trade-off it loses on today and the measurement
  that would justify revisiting it - plus the ones that have since **shipped**, kept for their
  measured result. Read it before proposing an optimisation - the shapes that look obvious and
  do not work are recorded here.

For a one-page overview, see the top-level [`README.md`](../README.md). For the terse
invariant list, see `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root.
