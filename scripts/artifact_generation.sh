#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# artifact_generation.sh - build the portable pack bundle in artifacts/: everything a SECOND
# machine needs to run `sopack pack`, and nothing it does not.
#
# The split that makes this possible: of the artifacts sopack needs, only ONE is host-specific.
# The stub blobs and both wbaes skeletons are Android target ELFs - they do not care what packed
# them - so they travel. `wb_keygen` is a native host binary and does not, so the bundle is
# pinned to the OS/arch that generated it and install.sh refuses a mismatched host.
#
# Generation works on macOS and on Linux - the two OSes that can build a native wb_keygen. On
# Linux it is linked STATICALLY (build_wbaes.sh does that), which is what lets a bundle built on
# Debian install on a RHEL-ish target; gate 4 below refuses to ship one that is not. Any other
# OS needs --allow-foreign-host, which omits the keygen and yields a chacha20/xor-only bundle.
#
# Separately, and not the same constraint: cross-building the SKELETONS needs an x86_64 host
# (there is no linux-aarch64 NDK toolchain, and O-MVLL's Linux plugin is x86_64-only). That is
# build_wbaes.sh's problem, and it does not arise under --skip-build.
#
# Scope is PACK-ONLY. The receiving machine runs sopack; it does not rebuild skeletons, so it
# needs no NDK, no cmake/ninja and no whitebox-cryptography checkout. artifacts/README.md spells
# out what it DOES need (JDK, apksigner) - that list is the point of the bundle.
#
# The bundle also carries THE TOOL, as a py3-none-any wheel with this ABI's skeletons baked in as
# package data. That is why the receiving machine needs no sopack checkout at all - it used to be
# told to `git clone` and `pip install -e .`, which is exactly what a machine "without source
# code" cannot do. See "gate 7 + the wheel" below for why the wheel is built from a STAGED tree.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/artifact_generation.sh                       # build, then bundle
#   ./scripts/artifact_generation.sh --skip-build --tar    # bundle what is already built
#   WBC=~/src/whitebox-cryptography ./scripts/artifact_generation.sh --tar
#
# Options:
#   --abi ABI            default arm64-v8a. Selects which skeleton PAIR is built and bundled;
#                        all three stub blobs ship regardless (they are 6-8 KB and committed).
#   --api N              default 24
#   --wbc PATH           whitebox-cryptography checkout. Else $WBC, else the pinned submodule
#                        at third_party/whitebox-cryptography (initialised on demand), else a
#                        sibling <repo>/../whitebox-cryptography.
#   --ndk PATH           Android NDK root.  Else $NDK / $ANDROID_NDK_HOME / $ANDROID_NDK_ROOT
#   --wb-keygen PATH     host wb_keygen. Else $SOPACK_WBKEYGEN, else <repo>/vendor/wbc/bin/
#                        wb_keygen - which is where build_wbaes.sh installs the one it builds,
#                        so --skip-build finds a previous run's keygen without being told.
#   --out DIR            default <repo>/artifacts
#   --skip-build         do not run build_wbaes.sh; bundle what is in sopack/stubs/ already.
#   --rebuild-stubs      also re-run stub/build_stubs.sh. OFF by default because stub_*.bin/.json
#                        are COMMITTED package data and a different LLVM produces different (still
#                        valid) blobs - i.e. a dirty tree you did not ask for.
#   --force              passed to build_wbaes.sh (redoes the cached host wb_keygen and Android
#                        libwbcrypto.a phases). Slow.
#   --allow-foreign-host generate on a host that cannot produce a usable wb_keygen (i.e. neither
#                        macOS nor Linux), or deliberately cut a keygen-free bundle on one that
#                        can. bin/wb_keygen is OMITTED and the bundle's config.yaml pins
#                        cipher: chacha20 (xor also works; wbaes cannot).
#   --allow-unobfuscated-provider
#                        build libsopk_wb.so WITHOUT O-MVLL. The provider is the artifact whose
#                        static-analysis resistance matters most, so this is never implied - not
#                        by the host, not by a missing plugin. It exists as the escape hatch for
#                        a host where the plugin will not load, and it is recorded in
#                        MANIFEST.txt as `provider-obfuscation: none`.
#   --tar                also write ../sopack-bundle-<abi>-<host>-<rev>.tar.gz next to --out.

# bundling for an aarch64 Linux pack host is perfectly coherent. What aarch64 Linux cannot do is
# cross-build the skeletons - Google ships no linux-aarch64 NDK toolchain - but that is Phase 4's

# Built from a STAGED copy in $TMP, never from $SOPACK, for two independent reasons:
#   1. package-data globs stubs/*.so. A build from the repo would sweep in skeletons for ABIs no

#   2. pyproject.toml must NOT gain stubs/*.so permanently. .gitignore:12-15 calls those a local

#      whatever happens to sit in sopack/stubs/ - including the --trace build that device_test.sh
#      writes to those exact paths and that gate 3 exists to refuse.
# The package-data line is therefore an OVERLAY on the staged tree: "a wheel with skeletons in it"
# stays a gated output of this script rather than something anyone can produce by accident.

# sopack portable pack bundle

This bundle is self-contained: it carries **the tool** (\`$WHEEL_NAME\`) as well as the
artifacts it needs. Everything in it is host-neutral - pure Python, or an **Android target ELF**
that does not care which machine packed it - except the single binary \`bin/wb_keygen\`, which is
why the bundle is pinned to $HOST_OS/$HOST_ARCH: see \`MANIFEST.txt\`.

Generated from sopack \`$SOPACK_REV\` for \`$ABI\` / android-$API.

## Install

\`\`\`bash
cd /path/to/this/bundle && ./install.sh
./venv/bin/sopack pack <your.apk> -o packed.apk --config ./config.yaml
\`\`\`

${KEYGEN_RECIPE_NOTE}

\`install.sh\` verifies the checksums, checks that this host can run \`bin/wb_keygen\`, creates a
virtualenv at \`./venv\`, installs the wheel into it, and then verifies that the installed sopack
can actually reach its own skeletons. **There is no repository to clone.**

The virtualenv is not tidiness: Homebrew's \`python3\` on macOS is externally managed (PEP 668),
so installing the wheel into it directly fails with \`error: externally-managed-environment\`.
Useful flags: \`--python PATH\` (build the venv from a specific interpreter), \`--no-venv\`
(install into \`python3 -m pip\` anyway), \`--no-keygen\` (skip \`bin/wb_keygen\` on a host that
cannot run it - you still get \`cipher: chacha20\`).

## What you still need on this machine

| Dependency | Why | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| Python >= 3.9 with \`venv\` | runs the tool; \`install.sh\` builds the venv with it | **yes** |
| **Network, once** | \`pip\` fetches \`lief\` while installing the wheel. Nothing else is downloaded | **yes**, at install time only |
| A **JDK** (\`keytool\`, \`java\`) | \`keytool\` runs on your **first pack even with no keystore configured** - sopack generates \`~/.sopack/debug.keystore\`. \`java\` is needed when apksigner resolves to a \`.jar\` | **yes**, every cipher |
| \`apksigner\` | signs the repackaged APK, and backs \`signing.verify\` | **yes**. Found on PATH, under \`\$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT\`/\`\$ANDROID_HOME\` \`build-tools/*\`, or via \`\$SOPACK_APKSIGNER_JAR\` |
| \`bin/wb_keygen\` (in this bundle) | seals the white-box blob at pack time | \`cipher: wbaes\` (the DEFAULT) only. Found automatically - it sits beside the venv \`install.sh\` creates, and sopack probes there |
| \`zipalign\` | 16 KB alignment of the output APK | optional - sopack falls back to a pure-Python aligner |
| \`openssl\` | fast ChaCha20 / AES-CTR | optional - pure-Python fallback runs at ~0.6 MB/s, so a multi-MB \`.text\` is slow but correct |

\`lief >= 1.0\` is a **hard floor**, pinned in the wheel's metadata so pip enforces it: 0.17.0
emitted 4 KB-aligned LOAD segments that fail sopack's 16 KB check.

**Not needed**, which is the whole point: **the sopack git repository**, the Android NDK, cmake,
ninja, a whitebox-cryptography checkout, or \`aapt\`. Those produced \`stubs/*\` on the generating
machine, and their output travels inside the wheel.

## Contents

| Path | Host-neutral? | What |
|---|---|---|
| \`$WHEEL_NAME\` | yes | **the tool**, pure Python. Carries the \`$ABI\` skeletons + all three ABIs' stub blobs as package data - which is why its version carries the \`+$WHEEL_LOCAL\` local tag naming the ABI, API level and sopack revision it was cut from. \`pip show sopack\` on this machine reads it back |
| \`stubs/stub_*.bin\`, \`stubs/stub_*.json\` | yes | freestanding stub blobs for all three ABIs (\`cipher: chacha20\`/\`xor\`), as loose copies |
| \`stubs/sopk_wb_$ABI.so\` | yes | the shared white-box provider, one per ABI. Obfuscation: **$PROVIDER_OBFUSCATION** |
| \`stubs/sopk_rt_$ABI.so\` | yes | the thin per-target helper skeleton the packer clones |
| \`bin/wb_keygen\` | **no** | host provisioning tool, $HOST_OS/$HOST_ARCH; linkage **$KEYGEN_LINKAGE** |
| \`config.yaml\` | yes | **the pack settings, fully commented.** Every option with an explanation - this file is the documentation. Two values are pinned to this bundle (\`cipher: $BUNDLE_CIPHER\`, \`abis: [$ABI]\`), marked BUNDLE-PINNED; the rest is at its default. Edit it in place |
| \`MANIFEST.txt\` | - | provenance; \`install.sh\` reads it back |
| \`SHA256SUMS\` | - | integrity, over every file including the wheel |

\`stubs/\` duplicates what is already inside the wheel. It is kept because it is a few hundred KB
and it is what you diff, checksum or hand to someone debugging a device failure - the installed
copy lives inside \`venv/\` where nobody looks.

Both skeletons are **release** builds: no logcat tracing, so a failure at load is a silent
SIGABRT by design. If a packed app crashes on device, rebuild with
\`./scripts/build_wbaes.sh --trace\` on the generating machine and pack with
\`logging.allow-helper-log: true\` in your config to find out why - do not ship that build.

  install.sh installs $WHEEL_NAME into a venv it creates
  beside itself, then verifies the installed sopack can reach its own skeletons. That machine
  needs Python >= 3.9 and network once (pip fetches lief).

  $(basename "$OUT")/README.md lists what else it needs (JDK + apksigner are the ones people
  forget; the sopack repo, the NDK and whitebox-cryptography are NOT needed).

  This bundle has NO wb_keygen (--allow-foreign-host on a $HOST_OS builder), so its config.yaml
  pins cipher: chacha20. Re-generate it on macOS for wbaes.
