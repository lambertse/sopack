# build_wbaes.sh - get `cipher: wbaes` from a clean checkout to a packable state, running
# Phases 1-4 of docs/technical/WBAES.md and every one of their PASS checks. It stops before
# packing (that needs YOUR APK and lib names) and prints the Phase-5 command to run next.
#
# Why a script: the failure modes of this mode are unforgiving and mostly SILENT. A pre-3.0.0
# libwbcrypto.a links cleanly and only breaks on device; a CACHED pre-3.0.0 host wb_keygen or
# archive survives an SDK upgrade and silently seals a heavy/v3 blob; a stale helper skeleton
# aborts on device naming the wrong cause; the wrong compiler driver leaves the whole C++
# runtime unresolved.
# Each of those has cost a debugging session here, so each is a hard gate below.
#
# WBC is a PINNED SUBMODULE at third_party/whitebox-cryptography - this script initialises it
# on demand, so a clean clone needs no arguments and no out-of-band drop. It needs network the
# first time: WBC's own third_party/fetch_deps.sh downloads libsodium and the O-MVLL plugin.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build_wbaes.sh                          # submodule + NDK from the environment
#   NDK=~/ndk/29 ./scripts/build_wbaes.sh
#   ./scripts/build_wbaes.sh --wbc ~/src/wbc --ndk ~/ndk/29     # an external WBC working copy
#
# Options:
#   --wbc PATH      whitebox-cryptography checkout (>= 3.0.0). Else $WBC, else the pinned
#                   submodule, else a sibling ../whitebox-cryptography, else prompt.
#   --ndk PATH      Android NDK root.               Else $NDK/$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/
#                   $ANDROID_NDK_ROOT, else prompt.
#   --abi ABI       default arm64-v8a
#   --api N         default 24
#   --release       build the skeleton WITHOUT -DSOPK_RT_LOG (no logcat tracing, no liblog).
#                   This is the DEFAULT - a tracing helper logs the target name, .text address
#                   and size to logcat, and `sopack pack` refuses to pack one.
#   --trace         opt into the tracing build for on-device Phase 6 verification. The result
#                   needs `logging.allow-helper-log: true` in the pack config, and is
#                   NOT shippable.
#   --omvll         configure the build WITH the O-MVLL obfuscation plugin. This is the DEFAULT.
#                   sopack owns the pin: scripts/fetch_omvll.sh vendors the plugin into
#                   third_party/omvll/ and it is passed INTO WBC. Applies to the vendored
#                   libwbcrypto.a AND to sopack's own skeletons (sopk_wb.c / sopk_rt.c).
#                   Works on macOS and Linux/x86_64 - upstream publishes a plugin for each.
#   --no-omvll      build unobfuscated. Needed on any other host, and the resulting provider
#                   is NOT what you should ship.
#   --skip-tests    skip Phase 2 (the unit tests)
#   --host-only     run Phases 1-3 only and stop. Needs no NDK, no cmake and no ninja, so the
#                   Python<->C contracts can be verified on a machine that cannot cross-compile
#                   (CI, for instance). No skeleton is produced, so you cannot pack afterwards.
#   --force         redo cached phases (host wb_keygen, Android libwbcrypto.a)
#
# SOPACK is this script's own repo - never asked for.

#                                     and the sealed blob. Exports exactly sopk_wb_k.
#   4b  sopk_rt.c  -> sopk_rt_<abi>.so  the THIN per-target helper. Links NO white-box; the
#                                     packer clones it per target.
#
# clang++ (not clang: the archive is C++) and libc++ STATIC for 4a - a libc++_shared.so
# dependency would be another .so to ship and the packer rejects it. -x c because both sources
# are C. --no-undefined so a pre-3.0.0 archive fails HERE instead of on device.
#
# -Wl,-soname on 4a is LOAD-BEARING, not tidiness: the thin helper's DT_NEEDED string is whatever
# the linker recorded as the provider's DT_SONAME, and without an explicit soname lld records the
# PATH it was given (".../sopack/stubs/sopk_wb_arm64-v8a.so"), producing an APK that cannot load.
# The packer asserts DT_SONAME == libsopk_wb.so rather than fixing it, because it cannot fix it.
#
# -g0 and -ffile-prefix-map are load-bearing for static-analysis resistance: a default build
# carries ~2.7 MB of DWARF naming every function (sopk_rt_ctor, the wbc_* API, the VM handlers)
# plus absolute host source paths, which leak a developer username and pin the vendored libsodium
# version. The packer strips what it can at pack time, but doing it here keeps the artifact
# honest. Note -ffile-prefix-map only rewrites paths for THESE files; strings baked into
# libwbcrypto.a need the same flag in the whitebox-cryptography build.
# ---- O-MVLL for sopack's OWN code ---------------------------------------------------------
# This used to be missing entirely: --omvll reached only WBC's build_android.sh, so the
# vendored libwbcrypto.a was obfuscated while sopack's own sopk_wb.c and sopk_rt.c - the region
# scan, the passphrase de-whitening, the wbc_* call sequence, the whole decrypt-and-place dance
# - shipped as plain -O2 clang output. MANIFEST.txt recorded `provider-obfuscation: omvll` the
# whole time, and install.sh presented that as a property of libsopk_wb.so. A control that
# reports itself present when it is absent is worse than a known gap: it stops anyone looking.
#
# WBAES.md Phase 4 already told a MANUAL builder to add plugin flags to these two lines and
# warned that leaving the thin helper unobfuscated is "a hardening regression versus the pre-v3
# single artifact". The automated path - the one BUILDING.md presents as the default - simply
# did not implement that warning.
#
# The config is sopack's own (stub/omvll_config_wb.py) and is passed PER-INVOCATION via env,
# never exported: WBC only defaults OMVLL_CONFIG when empty, so an exported value would leak
# into the sub-build and silently unobfuscate libwbcrypto.a.
# Version scripts pin the export sets, and they are REQUIRED whenever O-MVLL runs.
#
# -fvisibility=hidden is not sufficient: O-MVLL promotes the linkage of the functions it
# transforms, so an obfuscated thin helper - which must export NOTHING - came out exporting
# sopk_rt_ctor, self_cb, tgt_cb and sopk_wipe. That is a hardening regression in the exact shape
# this work is about: four internal function names, naming the protocol, added to .dynsym by the
# thing meant to hide them. Phase 4's own PASS gate caught it, which is the gate working.
#
# The provider needs the same treatment for the same reason; WBAES.md already documents this
# version script as its fallback. Written unconditionally so an unobfuscated build has the same
# export set as an obfuscated one - two link lines that differ only under a flag is how the two
# drift apart.

==> Host phases 1-4 PASS. Phase 5 is yours to run - it needs your APK and lib names:

  cd "$SOPACK"
  mkdir -p output
  python3 -m sopack.cli pack <your.apk> -o output/packed.apk

  The command line carries only the input and output APK. Everything else comes from
  ./config.yaml if you have one - and with no config at all the defaults are already right
  here: cipher wbaes, abis [$ABI], signature verification on, and every lib/$ABI/*.so in the
  APK selected. The keygen this phase just built is found at vendor/wbc/bin/wb_keygen; there
  is no flag and no config key for it.

  To narrow it to specific libraries, or point at your own keystore:

    python3 -m sopack.cli init-config       # writes ./config.yaml, fully commented
    #   libraries:
    #     include:
    #       - libfoo.so
    #       - libbar.so

Then verify the packed APK and go to device, per docs/technical/WBAES.md Phases 5-6.

  This skeleton is a TRACING build, so the helper logs a per-phase timing line at load:
      adb logcat -s sopk_rt sopk_wb DEBUG   # sopk_wb = the shared provider's tag
  It also needs 'pack --allow-helper-log', because those same lines hand an attacker the
  .text address and length to dump. Re-run WITHOUT --trace before shipping.
EOF
else
    cat <<EOF

  This skeleton is a RELEASE build: no logcat output, so a failure at load is a SIGABRT
  with no message (by design - see the fail-closed note in stub/sopk_rt.c). If the app
  crashes on device, rebuild with --trace and pack with --allow-helper-log to find out why.
