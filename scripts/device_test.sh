# device_test.sh - pack every APK in test_apks/ with cipher wbaes, run each one on a connected
# device, and report whether the injected helper actually decrypted what the packer claims it
# encrypted. Never aborts mid-run: one bad APK is a row in the report, not the end of the run.
#
# The failure this exists to catch is SILENT. A library that was packed but whose helper ctor
# never ran produces no crash and no message, so a human watching logcat records a pass. So the
# pass criterion is not "no crash" - it is "no crash AND the number of distinct libraries that
# logged a decrypt equals the number `sopack pack` said it injected".
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/device_test.sh                        # build once, then every test_apks/*.apk
#   ./scripts/device_test.sh --only Flappy          # just the APKs whose name matches
#   ./scripts/device_test.sh --skip-build --watch 30
#   ./scripts/device_test.sh --dry-run              # preflight + print, touch no device
#
# Options:
#   --only PAT        only APKs whose filename contains PAT (case-insensitive). Repeatable.
#   --watch N         seconds to watch each app after launch (default 15). A late-dlopen'ed
#                     library (the Flutter libapp.so case) legitimately needs a longer window;
#                     it shows up as WARN, not FAIL.
#   --skip-build      do not run build_wbaes.sh; assert the skeletons exist and are a --trace
#                     build. Use when you already built and are re-running the matrix.
#   --force-build     pass --force to build_wbaes.sh (redoes the cached host wb_keygen and
#                     Android libwbcrypto.a phases, and re-runs the unit tests). Slow.
#   --keep-installed  leave each app installed after its test (default: uninstall, to keep
#                     from filling device storage - packed APKs are LARGER than the input).
#   --dry-run         run preflight and aapt, print the pack/adb commands, touch no device.
#   --apks DIR        default <repo>/test_apks (the local APK corpus)
#   --out DIR         default <repo>/output/testrun
#   --abi ABI         default arm64-v8a (the only ABI sopack protects in practice)
#   --wbc PATH        whitebox-cryptography checkout.  Else $WBC, else the pinned submodule
#   --ndk PATH        Android NDK root.                Else $NDK/$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT
#   --wb-keygen PATH  host wb_keygen.                  Else $SOPACK_WBKEYGEN, else <repo>/vendor/wbc/bin/wb_keygen
#
# The APKs this produces are packed against a --trace (-DSOPK_RT_LOG) skeleton and need

# They are diagnostic builds. DO NOT SHIP THEM.

# up on invalid multibyte sequences and reports NO MATCH on data that plainly contains the
